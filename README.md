# Extract to Subdirectory Plugin for Obsidian

This Obsidian plugin allows you to extract notes to a subdirectory of the current folder, similiar to how attachments can be created.

(Extracted notes can only be extracted to the current folder, not a subfolder, via Obsidian's core plugin Note Composer.)

For faster extraction, a default note name is computed from the first N words of the selected text and a customizable prefix. This can be disabled.

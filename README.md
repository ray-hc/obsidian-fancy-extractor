# Extract to Subdirectory Plugin for Obsidian

This Obsidian plugin allows you to extract notes to a subdirectory of the current folder, similiar to how attachments can be created.

For convenience, a default note name is computed from the first N words of the selected text and a customizable prefix. This can be disabled.
